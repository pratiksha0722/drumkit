# drumkit
It is a javascript based application in which we can encounter the hints of various musical instruments by simply tapping on the picture of instrument or by squeezing key on the console.

I've got a number of keys here that represent different drums in a typical drum set.
And when you click on any of these buttons then you'll get the corresponding sound of the drum.
And in addition you can also use the keys on the keyboard.
